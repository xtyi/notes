# Magit

Magit is a complete text-based user interface to Git.

It fills the glaring gap between the Git command-line interface and various GUIs, letting you perform trivial as well as elaborate version control tasks with just a couple of mnemonic key presses.

Magit looks like a prettified version of what you get after running a few Git commands but in Magit every bit of visible information is also actionable to an extent that goes far beyond what any Git GUI provides and it takes care of automatically refreshing this output when it becomes outdated. In the background Magit just runs Git commands and if you wish you can see what exactly is being run, making it possible for you to learn the git command-line by using Magit.
