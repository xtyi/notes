# Torch-MLIR

https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir

The Torch-MLIR project aims to provide first class compiler support from the PyTorch ecosystem to the MLIR ecosystem.

PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that facilitates the seamless transition from research and prototyping to production-level deployment.

The MLIR project offers a novel approach for building extensible and reusable compiler architectures, which address the issue of software fragmentation, reduce the cost of developing domain-specific compilers, improve compilation for heterogeneous hardware, and promote compatibility between existing compilers.

Several vendors have adopted MLIR as the middle layer in their systems, enabling them to map frameworks such as PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow into MLIR and subsequently lower them to their target hardware.

We have observed half a dozen custom lowerings from PyTorch to MLIR, making it easier for hardware vendors to focus on their unique value, rather than needing to implement yet another PyTorch frontend for MLIR. The ultimate aim is to be similar to the current hardware vendors adding LLVM target support, rather than each one implementing Clang or a C++ frontend.

## All the roads from PyTorch to Torch MLIR Dialect

We have few paths to lower down to the Torch MLIR Dialect.
- ONNX as the entry points.
- Fx as the entry points

## Install torch-mlir snapshot

At the time of writing, we release [pre-built snapshots of torch-mlir](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir-release) for Python 3.11 and Python 3.10.

torch-mlir package 发布在

https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir-release/releases/expanded_assets/dev-wheels


安装过程:

获取 torch-mlir wheel 文件

```
wget https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir-release/releases/download/dev-wheels/torch_mlir-20240526.113-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
```

安装 torch-mlir, 这里指定一个额外的 index-url, 这样解析依赖的时候可以从这里下 nightly 的 pytorch

```
pip install torch_mlir-20240526.113-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

也可以合并上面两个步骤

```
pip install --pre torch-mlir -f https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir-release/releases/expanded_assets/dev-wheels --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```
