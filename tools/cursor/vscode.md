# Migrate from VSCode


## Why Not an Extension?


As a standalone application, Cursor has more control over the UI of the editor, enabling greater AI integration. Some of our features, like Cursor Tab and CMD-K, are not possible as plugins to existing coding environments.

## Why is the Activity Bar in Cursor horizontal?

The activity bar is horizontal by default to save room for chat. If you prefer the normal vertical activity bar you can go to the VS Code settings and set workbench.activityBar.orientation to vertical, and restart Cursor.
