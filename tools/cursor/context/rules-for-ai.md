You can add custom instructions to Cursor by modifying the Rules for AI section under Cursor Settings > General > Rules for AI.

This custom instruction will be included for features such as Cursor Chat and Ctrl/⌘ K.

可以设置 rules, cursor 里面用到 ai 的时候都会参考这些 rules

## `.cursorrules`

For project-specific instructions, you can include the instructions in a .cursorrules file in the root of your project.

As the same as the “Rules for AI” section, the instructions in the .cursorrules file will be included for features such as Cursor Chat and Ctrl/⌘ K.

可以设置项目级别的 rules, 使用 .cursorrules 文件
