# Common Issues

## I see an update on the changelog but Cursor won’t update.

If the update is very new, it might not have rolled out to you yet. We do staged rollouts, which means we release new updates to a few randomly selected users first before releasing them to everyone. Expect to get the update in a couple days!

## I have errors connecting to Remote SSH.

Currently, we don’t support SSHing into Mac or Windows machines. If you’re not using a Mac or Windows machine, please report your issue to us in the forum. It would be helpful to include some logs for better assistance.
