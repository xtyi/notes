# Generate Commit Message

Generate a commit message for your staged files

Cursor can help you generate meaningful commit messages for your changes with just a click. Here’s how to use this feature:

1. Stage the files you want to commit
2. Open the Git tab in the sidebar
3. Look for the sparkle (✨) icon next to the commit message input field
4. Click the sparkle icon to generate a commit message based on your staged changes

The generated commit message will be based on the changes in your staged files and your repository’s git history. This means the AI will analyze both your current changes and previous commit messages to generate a contextually appropriate message. Cursor learns from your commit history, which means if you use conventions like Conventional Commits, the generated messages will follow the same pattern.
