# Decision Trees

**At a basic level, machine learning is about predicting the future based on the past.**

In general, this means making informed guesses about some unobserved property of some object, based on observed properties of that object.

Generalization 泛化

This general set up of predicting the future based on the past is at the core of most machine learning.

The objects that our algorithm will make predictions about are examples.

To make this concrete, Figure 1.1 shows the general framework of induction.
