# Chapter 1: Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits

http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

the neural network uses the examples to automatically infer rules for recognizing handwritten digits.

along the way we'll develop many key ideas about neural networks, including two important types of artificial neuron (the perceptron and the sigmoid neuron), and the standard learning algorithm for neural networks, known as stochastic gradient descent.

## Perceptrons

Perceptrons were developed in the 1950s and 1960s by the scientist Frank Rosenblatt, inspired by earlier work by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. 

Today, it's more common to use other models of artificial neurons - in this book, and in much modern work on neural networks, the main neuron model used is one called the sigmoid neuron. We'll get to sigmoid neurons shortly. But to understand why sigmoid neurons are defined the way they are, it's worth taking the time to first understand perceptrons.


... important math formula

That's the basic mathematical model. A way you can think about the perceptron is that it's a device that makes decisions by weighing up evidence.
